    "\n",
    "The purpose of this assignment is for you to begin the process of using the data science tools introduced in class to begin analyzing your data (or data similar to it). The end point of this workshop will vary based on the complexity of the data and your familiarity with the programming tools, but the goal is for you to establish some of the basic workflows you will need to complete your final project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The products of this assignment are:\n",
    "1. **This notebook** which should include not only the code you use but descriptions and explanations of what you re doing using Markdown text blocks.\n",
    "2. **Some form of processed data** stored as  HDF5, CSV, or another appropriate file format.  \n",
    "3. **Visualizations produced from your data** saved as PDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "**All three should be submitted to Canvas.** "
