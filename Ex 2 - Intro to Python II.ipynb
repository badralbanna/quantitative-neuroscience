Python has many advantages, but it was not optimized for data manipulation - instead it was optimized for ease of use and flexiblity. Specifically, the way that python stores sets is not efficient for computations. Each element of a list is really a \"pointer\" to a memeory location that contains the object in question. These locations could be all over the place so as you can imagine if you need to conduct operations that require manipulating many elements at the same time this will be very slow as the program must constantly search all over memory to complete the task. \n",

These arrays are typically numbers but they can contain any other type of python object and even custom types (see [dtype section](#dtype)).
